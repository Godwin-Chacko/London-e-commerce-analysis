## Project Background

London is a sample e-commerce company that sells holiday decor, baking and pantry items and vintage items worldwide.

The company has significant amounts of data on its Transactions, customers and  product offerings, that has been previously underutilized. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will improve London's commercial success.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

**Sales Trends Analysis**: Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Order Volume, and Average Order Value (AOV). Additional metrics such as product sales volume were also considered to support deeper insights where relevant.


**Product Performance**: An analysis of the business's various products and product catergories, understanding their impact on Revenue, orders and returns.


The data is organized across four tables: `Customers`, `Transactions`, `TransactionDetails`, `Products`,  and `Categories` .

## Addendum: Notes on Data Cleaning

During the data cleaning process, I identified 9,956 duplicate entries in the original Excel dataset. To ensure the integrity and accuracy of the analysis, these duplicates were removed. As a result, the initial total of 536,350 entries was reduced to 526,394 entries. This step was crucial for maintaining the validity and reliability of the insights derived from the data.
